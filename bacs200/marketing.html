    <p>
	Growing up I participated in the Summer and Winter Special Olympics as a volunteer. While volunteering, I was able to participate in various sports with the athletes. I remember as a kid participating in the snowshoe events up in Vail, Colorado. Seeing the joy on everyone's faces because they finally had a platform to be themselves, was life-changing.
