              <p>Who inspires you? An athlete you grew up watching? The author of your favorite book?
              Maybe it's a family member or your favorite high school teacher
              Personally, I have all the aforementioned inspirations in my life. I believe people should have different
              inspirations for instances of their lives.</p>
              
              <p>My musical inspiration is Mozart. No, I do not play any instruments, but I love listening to music! </p>
              <p>Mozart inspires me because:
               <ul>
                <li>He took a chance! He was the first composer to blend multiple styles together. Mozart
              is one of the reasons, that when you're scrolling on Spotify, you can pick from the 100s of genres.</li> 
                <li>He is well versed! Not only did he compose musical pieces, he also knew how to play 5 instruments!</li>
              
                That inspires me to add as many "tools" to my toolbag as I can as I progress throughout life.</p>
